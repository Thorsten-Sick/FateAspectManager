# Fate Aspect manager

Click on an aspect after you used it against a player. Cards and aspects will be re-sorted so that player aspects can be triggered in a fair distribution.

## Quality and Background

I just did the GTK tutorial and wanted to find a challenge to test my new learned skills (and experiment with GTK). For this reason this code is currently:

* Totally hacky (i tested stuff)
* Not best practice (same reason)

By sheer accident it is not totally useless. So I will be leaving it here and clean up the code (with GTK best practice).
